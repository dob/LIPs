## Abstract

This proposal describes a bundle of LIPs that establish an onchain Livepeer Treasury, governed by the community.

## Specification

LIPs included in the bundle are:

- [LIP-livepeer_treasury](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-livepeer_treasury.md): Livepeer Treasury
- [LIP-funding_entity_conventions](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-funding_entity_conventions.md): Funding Entity Conventions

## Specification Rationale

LIP-X and LIP-Y (placeholders to avoid the longform names until numbers are assigned) are bundled because LIP-Y requires LIP-X in order to determine whether an onchain treasury exists in which proposals can be made. The community can evaluate this parent LIP to determine whether to accept or reject LIP-X and LIP-Y as a bundle.
