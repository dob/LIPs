## Abstract

This proposal describes a bundle of LIPs that establish an onchain Livepeer Treasury, governed by the community, along with an explicit set of social conventions for what valid uses of the treasury are and how it should be governed.

## Specification

LIPs included in the bundle are:

- [LIP-88](LIP-88.md): Livepeer Treasury
- [LIP-89](LIP-89.md): Funding Entity Conventions

## Specification Rationale

LIP-89 and LIP-90 are bundled because LIP-90 requires LIP-89 in order to determine whether an onchain treasury exists in which proposals can be made. The community can evaluate this parent LIP to determine whether to accept or reject LIP-89 and LIP-90 as a bundle.
