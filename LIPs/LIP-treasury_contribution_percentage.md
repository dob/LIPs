## Abstract

This proposal, one piece of the larger set of changes codenamed Livepeer Delta, describes a mechanism for populating the Livepeer Treasury via a parameterized percentage of the per round mintable tokens that the Livepeer protocol generates. It includes implementation details, and also includes a governable maximum treasury balance parameter, such that treasury contributions would stop should the treasury balance exceed this value.
