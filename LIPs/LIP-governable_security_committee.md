## Abstract

This proposal, one piece of the larger set of changes codenamed Livepeer Delta, describes a mechanism for introducing binding on chain governance over key actions related to the Livepeer Protocol Security Committee. Namely, it introduces mechanisms for adding keyholders to the committee, removing keyholders from the committee, updating the number of signatures required for committee action.

**THIS DOCUMENT IS A PLACEHOLDER DRAFT**
While far from a complete LIP, we felt it important to include this placeholder at the time of submitting the additional Livepeer Delta governance proposals, as it is an important motivating element for the Delta proposal, and is intended as a potential fast follow should the Delta proposals pass.
